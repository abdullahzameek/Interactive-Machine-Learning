"After spending some years at NYUAD, I've come to understand what it is about this place and being here that often drives us crazy. I have lost count of the number of times I've heard people say that coming here has been great but they've actually become less confident than what they used to be in high school. After interacting with many,‚Ä¶ More many people and having the deepest of introspections I have come to realize the following:  You can't be everything. You can and should play another octave, but you can't play every octave. Find one or two things you like and enjoy doing and use the university's resources to become better at it.

My gratitude to you is ineffable! You know, before you happened to me, I used to think that I was staggering from all the shit that fell on my shoulders. How wrong I was! Your frivolity with the gum took the wool off my eyes, unveiling how‚Ä¶ More much free time I indeed have to go around campus in attempts to find a cleaning service just to finally hear that the fabric my pants were made from cannot be dry cleaned. I used to think that the amount of my problems has reached the apogee; apparently, I still have some extra stress space left. Now my pants with a sticky gum do not just symbolize my despair and distress, they also act as an eternal idol of our new-born relationship. You might think this was a sarcasm, nay thingy vailed contempt, but I will be honest: this gum will firmly hold our mutual love till the very moment I find you and stick it into your throat in hopes of seeing you suffocating.

Here, I've developed a lot more connections -- with both nyuny kids and locals -- than I cumulatively did on campus. What's more, I think I might have found "the one." Now that I've got a grasp of this life, I don't think I want to go back to Abu Dhabi.

Seriously, what happened to human decency? I‚Äôm not talking about hookup situations where both people know or have commucated clearly what‚Äôs going on. But if you‚Äôre seeing someone especially repeatedly, you know they feel it more than you, you know you have no intention of anything, honestly how can you not take your position as the less emotionally attatched to show this person mercy and let them go? Is it difficult to offer them that kindness? Is it that easy to be lazy with other people‚Äôs emotional well-being all because you‚Äôre unsure or because to you it‚Äôs not that deep? "

"The temporariness of this school is tearing me apart. There are just sooo many amazing people that you get to meet and know and love. It's killing me to know that there are some people I may never see again (shout out to the study aways.. you guys are amazing) and some I won't see for at least a year if not more (to all my friends I love‚Ä¶ More you so much) and some people who will pass by before I even get to learn how great they are (to those people I respect you anyway).

So take an extra minute to thank them! We would really not be able to succeed without them, but they rarely get the thanks they deserve. Let's remember to let them know we see them, care for them, and appreciate them üíó "

"Seniors, don't ever let anyone tell you that you don't have time anymore and that you should make up your mind as to what you want to do post-graduation.

"Everyone can't wait for the semester to be over but I'm not really excited about winter break. It's not that I don't really want to spend time back at home but I just love it here. I'm not looking forward to leaving, even if it's for a few weeks. Especially since so many of my friends are going to be gone when I come back, and I won't see‚Ä¶ More them for a year. Even though we have issues sometimes, I can't imagine this place without them...
In these last few days, please appreciate where you are and the people around you. I know we all have finals but make time to spend with your friends and make memories. grades aren't everything. Live in the moment instead of constantly thinking of the moment you'll get out of here. Go to events, celebrate holidays you have no business celebrating, go out once with your friends, take a break or two. Stop procrastination, do the work you need to get done everyday, and then enjoy yourself everyday. You can do it! "

I really want to focus but having no one to cuddle with, to share food, to stare into each other‚Äôs eyes and forget about everything... is really making me sad.
